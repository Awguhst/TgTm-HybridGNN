# ðŸ§ª HybridGNN Polymer Property Predictor

This project presents a machine learning framework for the **simultaneous prediction** of two fundamental thermal properties of polymers:

- **Glass Transition Temperature (Tg)**
- **Melting Temperature (Tm)**

given their **monomer SMILES representations**.

The core model leverages a **Hybrid Graph Neural Network (HybridGNN)** architecture that combines **graph-based molecular structure** with **physicochemical descriptors** for accurate, data-driven predictions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

Understanding and predicting polymer thermal properties is essential for designing new materials in fields such as packaging, coatings, electronics, and aerospace. Traditional experimental methods are resource-intensive and time-consuming.

This project aims to **accelerate discovery** by combining recent advances in **graph-based deep learning** with domain-specific chemical descriptors, enabling rapid and accessible property prediction.

## ðŸ”¬ Overview

The prediction model is based on a **HybridGNN** architecture that:

- Constructs a graph representation of the monomer using atom/bond information
- Extracts RDKit-based descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, LogP, H-bond acceptors)
- Applies **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce descriptor dimensionality
- Fuses the learned **graph embeddings** with **descriptor vectors**
- Performs **multi-target regression** to jointly predict Tg and Tm

An interactive **Streamlit-based interface** allows users to input SMILES strings and instantly visualize and predict polymer properties.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

The HybridGNN consists of a stack of:

- `Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)`
- `Graph Attention Network (GAT)`
- `GraphConv` layers

These layers extract multi-scale structural information, which is then combined with compressed descriptors through fully connected layers.
